                <h2>Billionaire, genius, playboy</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Tony Stark’s universe — where the tech is smarter than your phone, the ego is bigger than
                    his bank account,
                    and saving the world is just another item on his to-do list (right after brunch). He’s rich enough
                    to buy a country,
                    genius enough to build a suit of armor in a cave, and charming enough to make even his enemies pause
                    and say, “Okay,
                    that was kinda cool.”</p>

                <h2>Not just armor — it’s a high-tech, high-drip masterpiece.</h2>
                <p>From a DIY metal can in a cave to nanotech wizardry that assembles mid-air, the Iron Man suit is the
                    ultimate glow-up.
                    Packed with more gadgets than a Bond car and more attitude than Stark himself, it’s what happens
                    when a billionaire gets
                    bored and decides to outdo the military… for fun. Flight? Check. Lasers? Check. Dramatic superhero
                    landings? Absolutely
                    essential.</p>

            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <div class="experience">
                <h1>Inventor of the Arc Reactor</h1>
                <h4>2010</h4>
                <p>While most billionaires were building rocket ships for fun, Tony created a clean energy source that
                    could power cities…
                    or a mini-reactor in his chest to keep shrapnel from piercing his heart. Casual.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h1>Creates Ultron (Oops)</h1>
                <h4>2012</h4>
                <p>Tried to save the world by building a peacekeeping AI. Instead, created a sentient murder bot with
                    daddy issues. Not his
                    best moment, but hey — he also built Vision, so it kinda evens out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h1>Battles Thanos on Titan</h1>
                <h4>2018</h4>
                <p>Zooms into space with Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, fights the galaxy’s biggest purple problem, and
                    nearly stops the
                    Snap. Gives it everything — including a planet thrown at his face.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h1>Time Travel Mastermind</h1>
                <h4>2023</h4>
                <p>While everyone else was sulking, Tony figured out how to time travel using quantum physics and
                    leftover cereal. His
                    brain saved half the universe before breakfast.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h1>I am Iron Man</h1>
                <h4>2023</h4>
                <p>In the ultimate act of heroism, he steals the Infinity Stones, snaps away Thanos and his army, and
                    seals his place as
                    the heart of the MCU. One snap. One line. One legacy.
