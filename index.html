                <h2>Billionaire, genius, playboy</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Tony Stark’s universe — where the tech is smarter than your phone, the ego is bigger than
                    his bank account,
                    and saving the world is just another item on his to-do list (right after brunch). He’s rich enough
                    to buy a country,
                    genius enough to build a suit of armor in a cave, and charming enough to make even his enemies pause
                    and say, “Okay,
                    that was kinda cool.”</p>

                <h2>Not just armor — it’s a high-tech, high-drip masterpiece.</h2>
                <p>From a DIY metal can in a cave to nanotech wizardry that assembles mid-air, the Iron Man suit is the
                    ultimate glow-up.
                    Packed with more gadgets than a Bond car and more attitude than Stark himself, it’s what happens
                    when a billionaire gets
                    bored and decides to outdo the military… for fun. Flight? Check. Lasers? Check. Dramatic superhero
                    landings? Absolutely
                    essential.</p>
