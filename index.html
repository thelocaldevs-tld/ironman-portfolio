                <p>Welcome to Tony Stark’s universe — where the tech is smarter than your phone, the ego is bigger than
                    his bank account,
                    and saving the world is just another item on his to-do list (right after brunch). He’s rich enough
                    to buy a country,
                    genius enough to build a suit of armor in a cave, and charming enough to make even his enemies pause
                    and say, “Okay,
                    that was kinda cool.”</p>
